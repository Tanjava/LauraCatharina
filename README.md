# Design

The design for the website was based on this mood board.

<img moodboard src="https://tinyurl.com/bdz6ev6y" width="350">


## Color Scheme

Based on the mood board, the following colors were chosen to capture the feel and style of the website:

![Color palette](assets/readme-images/LC-color-palette.png)


## Typography

Tan Mon Cheri is a sans-serif font that has an overall light and airy feel, whereas Quicksand is a simple and clean sans-serif font. The combination of these fonts gives a minimal, clean, elegant and modern look to the site and the special dot above the lowercase letter ‘i’ of the Tan Mon Cheri font subtlety ties in with the astrology theme of the website.


## Images

The main colors of the website are brown and beige to create an overall calm and natural feel. The images add the pop of pink and green color. 



# Features

## Existing Features:

This is a seven page website with a Thank You page. 


### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Navigation

The navigation bar is fixed on top for easy navigation between the pages. It has a logo on the left and a main menu with four buttons (one per page) and a submenu with three buttons (one per page) on the right. The navigation bar adjusts in size as the screen size decreases. On very small screen sizes the logo positions on top of the main menu.

### Website banner

Under the header the website has a banner. The banner image has a different cover text for every page. It has a page title, a little icon to match the page and a three keyword description of that page.

![Website banner](assets/readme-images/LC-hero-image.png)

### Fixed Social Media Sidebar

A social media sidebar is positioned on the left hand side of the page with a fixed position, meaning that when the user scrolls the page, the sidebar will remain in the same position. This serves as a quick and easy way for users to:
- get in touch with the website owner by clicking on the email icon and;
- connect with the website on other platforms by clicking the Instagram/TikTok icon, increasing the reach of the website’s content and potentially driving more traffic to the website. 

This feature is hidden on devices of 580px wide and down.


### Home Page

This page is the first page users will see. It has a 'Welcome' and a 'Work With Me' section, and is designed to capture their attention and encourage themn to explore the website further.


#### Welcome

This section welcomes the user and gives a short introduction about the website owner and the website itself. 

![Welcome!](assets/readme-images/LC-welcome.png)


#### Work with me

![Work with me](assets/readme-images/LC-work-with-me.png)


#### Reviews

This section shows testimonials from users, highlighting their positive experiences working with the website owner and the readings received. This adds credibility to the website and helps others feel confident in working with the website owner and the readings they’ll receive.

The reviews are shown on the home page as well as the general readings page and individual readings pages (Big Three, Career and Birth Chart).

## Future Features

- Blog page - for everyone’s weekly dose of astrology, spirituality and wellness, and to interact with customers and build relationships.

- Shopping Cart feature – for users to purchase the personalized astrology readings directly through the website 


# Testing

Testing of the website has been conducted on a laptop using GOogle Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and mobile using Safari and Android. Google DevTools was used to test different devices and screen resolutions. 

Navigation, all of the links and the contact form function as expected.

When I first ran my code through the W3C HTML and CSS validators some sections failed and required some minor changes. 


## Validator Testing

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fangelicaguimaraes.github.io%2Fmagnolia_tree%2Findex.html)

![W3C HTML Validator](assets/readme-images/LC-html-checker.png)

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official ([Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fangelicaguimaraes.github.io%2Fmagnolia_tree%2Findex.html&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)) validator:

NB: Although the above screenshots show the results of the home page, the results are the same on every other page of the website.


## Unfixed Bugs

Initially, when using the site on mobile resolution, the hoverable navigation of the Readings, and it's submenu, couldn't be accessed as the dropdown menu briefly appeared when clicking on Readings, but the navigation then immediatly reloaded and disappeared. The user would have to click Readings, hold it and then drag down to the submenu for the readings button and submenu buttons to be accessible. 

To fix this when using the site on mobile resolution, I created a clickable dropdown menu with a down arrow symbol. It still doesn't work perfectly as the user now has to click the precise down arrow target area in order to be able to use the submenu, but at least the readings button and submenu buttons are accessible this way. In case the user does not click the precise down arrow target area, they will be led to the Readings page and can always navigate to the specific readings from there. 


## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
